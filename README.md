# PainKiller Advanced Cheats

## Description

“PainKiller Advanced Cheats” (shortly “PainCheats”, or “PKCheats”) is a cheat script for one of the greatest video game series of the recent years, “PainKiller”.

The latest stable version of “PainCheats” contains 138 console cheat commands for the single-player game mode:

* all of the original cheats;
* cheats disabled in the retail version of the game;
* most of the cheats from “Powermad” cheat script, originally created by *Wayne Marsh a.k.a. fleabay* and later developed by *Peter Kuhn a.k.a. kalme*;
* cheats developed by fans and published on various “PainKiller” forums;
* and lots and lots of exclusive cheats.

Most of them have been modified and/or bug fixed.

“PainCheats” is compatible with all currently existing and possibly with future versions of the game.

“PainCheats” can be installed into any official and unofficial editions, demos, add-ons, mods and ports of “PainKiller” that use “PainEngine” video game engine (e.g., “PainKiller: Battle out of hell” by “People Can Fly”, “PainKiller: Overdose” by “Mindware”, etc.).

“PainCheats” can also be installed into “PainKiller: Hell wars” video game developed by “People Can Fly” for “Xbox Original” video game console that uses slightly modified version of “PainEngine”.

“PainCheats” can not be installed into “PainKiller: Hell & Damnation” by “The Farm 51” that uses “Unreal Engine 3” video game engine.

“PainCheats” is compatible with other cheat scripts (e.g., “Powermad”).

“PainCheats” can be ported to “NecroVisioN” video game by “The Farm 51” that uses “NecroEngine” video game engine, based on “PainEngine”. The good project name might be “NecroVisioN Advanced Cheats” (shortly “NecroCheats”, or “NVNCheats”).
